# Unity_Enemy_Hierarchy_with_ScriptableObjects
Enemy hierarchy system with stats and types, using ScriptableObjects.

 This project demonstrates an enemy system in Unity, using ScriptableObjects to centralize data and inheritance to implement unique behaviors per enemy. The concept was inspired by the bestiary of Final Fantasy XII.
I create a modular structure for enemies with:

Attribute customization via ScriptableObjects
Visual feedback (flashing red when taking damage)
Inheritance for individual attacks per class
Input reading for quick testing
Combat and death debugging in the Console
